Each student is issued a Patient  Reference Card with his/her medical number and photograph on  it. Students are encouraged to present the registration card on  each visit to facilitate prompt medical attention.   2.8.1.  Early Presentation and Compliance  Students are admonished to present themselves at the Medical  Centre early in the course of illness and avoid self-medication.  They are also encouraged to adhere strictly to prescriptions and  instructions from the Medical Centre. This will help reduce the  cost of health care delivery occasioned by the use of more  expensive second and third-line drugs due to the abuse of first- line drugs. A student who is unable to report at the Medical Centre  should intimate another student to report to the Hall Staff who  shall arrange for the Medical Shuttle immediately. Students  suffering from infectious or contagious diseases shall be required  to take a leave from the university during the time of illness.
